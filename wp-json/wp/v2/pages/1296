The conference is a community event with participation open to anyone interested in open source geospatial technology, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, political views, physical appearance, disability, or financial situation.  Indeed, attendees are warmly invited from around the world and not just North America.<\/p>\n<p>By attending the conference or any associated event, you agree to follow this code of conduct.<\/p>\n<h5>Appropriate Behavior<\/h5>\n<p>Any behavior that infringes on another person&#8217;s enjoyment of the conference is inappropriate.  Inappropriate behavior may include actions directed at a specific individual, a class of people, or simply those nearby.  Inappropriate behavior may include harassment, pranks, physical touching, aggressive behavior, cornering, or violent actions.  No one has the right to make his\/her\/their experience more enjoyable at the negative expense of other persons.<\/p>\n<p>During this amazing conference, you may hear new ideas, discover new technology, and make new friends!

You can email the conference committee at <a href=\"mailto:safety@foss4g-na.org\">safety@foss4g-na.org<\/a> or notify any staff member in-person.<\/p>\n<p>If you do get called out for inappropriate conduct, it is easy to feel caught in a complex tangle of emotions: shame, confusion, anger, embarrassment. This may only increase when those calling you out are not doing so gently.  However, as a member of our community, it is your responsibility to respond in a way that promotes healing and personal growth.  Even if your actions were simply misinterpreted, it is important for you to respect how others feel and show kindness.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to report and incident after the event, please email <a href=\"mailto:safety@foss4g-na.org\">safety@foss4g-na.org<\/a> with the relevant details, including where, when, witnesses, and corroborating evidence.  The committee will investigate all reported incidents.<\/p>\n<h5>Enforcement<\/h5>\n<p>The  conference committee will not tolerate harassment or inappropriate conduct of any kind toward attendees, organizers, volunteers, presenters, instructors, sponsors, staff, or vendors during the conference and associated events.  The committee reserves the right to take any action up to and including expulsion from the conference with no refund.<\/p>\n<p>As appropriate, the committee with work with local law enforcement to investigate any suspected activity illegal in the local jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<h5>Limitations<\/h5>\n<p>The Code of Conduct applies to all events associated with the conference, including any official social events at offsite locations.
